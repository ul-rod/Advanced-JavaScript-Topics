/**
OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- An object is Data and Behaviors packaged together.
- JavaScript links objects together using the prototype.
- JavaScript uses a Prototypal Inheritance.

Why use an OOP approach?
- Help reduce errors when updating your code.
- Helps to structure your code using an accepted paradigm.
- Makes your code more readable.
- Makes your code more reusable.

Inheritance:
- An object that is able to inherit methods and properties from another object.
- Giving an object access to another objects methods and properties.
- It enables code reuse!

Encapsulation:
- Enclosing all functionalities of an object (data and methods) within that object,
  so the object's internal workings are hidden from the rest of the application.
- Why is this important? Encapsulation governs how we set up our objects. It Helps
  us make more maintainabale and scalable.
